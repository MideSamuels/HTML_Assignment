                My name is Olamide Samuel, and I am a passionate and self-motivated individual with a keen interest in technology and innovation.
                I have always been fascinated by how the internet and cloud technologies power the modern world, from businesses to everyday 
                applications. This curiosity has driven me to explore the field of Cloud Engineering, as I aim to build a career where I can 
                design, deploy, and manage scalable cloud solutions that solve real-world problems.
                I joined AltSchool Africa because of its hands-on, practical approach to learning. I believe that the structured curriculum,
                 mentorship opportunities, and community-driven environment will provide me with the technical skills and real-world 
                experience needed to thrive in the cloud computing industry. AltSchool’s emphasis on practical projects aligns perfectly with
                my learning style, as I prefer applying concepts in real-time rather than just theoretical learning.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                By enrolling in AltSchool Africa’s Cloud Engineering program, I hope to gain expertise in cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and 
                Google Cloud, understand DevOps principles, and develop skills in automation and infrastructure management. My goal is to 
                become a proficient Cloud Engineer who can contribute to the growing tech ecosystem in Africa and beyond.I am ready to commit 
                myself fully to this learning journey, and I believe that AltSchool Africa will equip me with the knowledge and network to achieve 
                my dreams.
